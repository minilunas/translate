Researchers, writing in the journal Heart, pooled data from 23 studies and found that social isolation or feelings of loneliness were tied to an increased risk for coronary heart disease and stroke.  
据一篇发表在心脏杂志上的研究所说，研究者经过23份数据的合并研究发现，社交孤立或孤独症会导致冠心病和中风的患病几率增加。

The studies included data from 181,006 men and women 18 and older. There were 4,628 coronary events and 3,002 strokes in follow-up periods ranging from three to 21 years. Three of the papers measured loneliness, 18 looked at social isolation and two included both. Social isolation and loneliness were determined with questionnaires; the researchers depended on medical records and death certificates for determining coronary events and stroke.  
研究追踪了181,006个人，年龄从18岁起。在研究开始的3至21年间，发生了4,628起冠心病和3,002起中风。三分之一是孤独症，18起社交孤立和2起两个症状都有。社交孤立和孤独症是根据调查问卷确定的。研究者的依据是医疗记录以及冠状动脉事件和中风的确定死亡证明。

The scientists found that loneliness and social isolation increased the relative risk of having a heart attack, angina or a death from heart disease by 29 percent, and the risk of stroke by 32 percent. There were no differences between men and women.  
科学家发现孤独症和社交孤立可以增加约29%~32%与心脏病相关的致病率，比如心绞痛或心脏疾病致死，而这与性别无关。

“People have tended to focus from a policy point of view at targeting lonely people to make them more connected,” said the lead author, Nicole K. Valtorta, a research fellow at the University of York in England. “Our study shows that if this is a risk factor, then we should be trying to prevent the risk factor in the first place.”  
“人们往往注重从政策角度针对孤独的人使他们更紧密，”主要作者Nicole K. Valtorta说，一位英国约克大学的研究员。“我们的研究表明，如果这是一个风险因素，那么我们应该尝试从开始的地方来防止风险。”

The authors acknowledge that this was a review of observational studies and did not establish cause and effect.  
作者承认，这是一个观察性研究的，并没有建立因果证明。
